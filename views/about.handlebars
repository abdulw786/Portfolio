        <p>Who can be funnier than I am? Making fun of yourself is the sense of humor that is widely understandable
              across most nations. At least, when you say funny sayings about yourself, no-one would feel insulted. So
              go ahead to learn some funny sayings that you can say about yourself. Yes, I do bad things, but I do them
              well. I never thought I had such an exciting life, before I heard what people talk about me.
              who knows me can be divided into two groups: those who like me and those who still don’t know me. I’m not
              sarcastic only when I sleep. When you stop worrying about what people will say, then you start being
              yourself. You are not supposed
              to like me, because I’m not a Facebook status. The reason why people don’t want to hear the truth about
              them is because they are afraid that their illusions about themselves might be destroyed. I love myself
              more than I love you.</p>
